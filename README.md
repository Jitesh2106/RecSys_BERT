# Recommendation System with BERT and K-Means

This repository contains code for building a recommendation system using the BERT model to extract meaningful representations from data and the K-Means algorithm for clustering and enhancing data analysis and recommendations.

## Overview

Recommendation systems are widely used in various applications to suggest items or content to users based on their preferences and behavior. In this project, I leveraged the power of BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, to capture semantic relationships and understand the context of user preferences and product features.

## Key Features

- Utilizes BERT to extract meaningful embeddings from textual data.
- Applies K-Means clustering on the BERT embeddings to enhance data analysis and recommendation capabilities.
- Provides a recommendation based on the items present in the user's cart.
